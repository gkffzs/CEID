#### (23Y343) - Scientific Calculation I [:link:](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en/undergraduate/courses/23%CE%A5343)
This repository contains the three course assignments for the academic period of 2013-2014, done by
[George Kaffezas](https://github.com/gkffzs).In order to test any of the code in these assignments, you should have a
version of [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) installed (for these cases, version R2012b was used).

###### [Assignment #1](https://github.com/gkffzs/CEID/tree/master/23Y343/Assignment%20%231)
For this assignment we had to evaluate several basic linear algebra calculations (like LU, QR, etc), compare different
implementations of a matrix-vector multiplication, and create a simple mathematical model for comparing times and
efficiency. So, in this folder we have:
- `/files`: the directory where all source code is included, along with figures and results
- `4465_prb1_report.pdf`: report with analysis and code (in Greek)
- `prb1.pdf`: the assignment in details (in Greek)

###### [Assignment #2](https://github.com/gkffzs/CEID/tree/master/23Y343/Assignment%20%232)
For this assignment we had to check several characteristics of MATLAB, in regards to precision and arithmetic values,
how numbers are stored and perform a convergance test with non-convergant series. Also, we had to specify their
implications on several polynomials and related functions (like poly, roots, etc), and finally to check the backward 
stability of Horner's algorithm and calculate some errors. So, in this folder we have again:
- `/files`: the directory where all source code is included, along with figures and results
- `4465_prb2_report.pdf`: report with analysis and code (in Greek)
- `prb2.pdf`: the assignment in details (in Greek)

###### [Assignment #3](https://github.com/gkffzs/CEID/tree/master/23Y343/Assignment%20%233)
There were several objectives in this assignment, but, due to lack of time and knowledge, I managed to do only the first
exercise, which was about creating a matrix with a specified condition number. So, in this folder we have:
- `/files`: the directory where all source code is included
- `4465_prb3_report.pdf`: report with analysis and code (in Greek)
- `prb3.pdf`: the assignment in details (in Greek)
