## CEID Repository
Current repository includes several projects, scripts and programs that I've written (by myself and in collaboration)
as an undergraduate student of the [Computer Engineering & Informatics Department](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/)
(CEID) at the [University of Patras](http://www.upatras.gr/). These are projects that, on the one hand, I was allowed
to upload, and on the other hand, their being online on GitHub as standalones was meaningful. All descriptions are in 
English, although some comments and most reports and assignments are in Greek.

#### List of courses
The following list is not an exhaustive list, but a list of selected projects for a few courses. The complete course
list can be found [here](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en/undergraduate/courses). Note that the first column points to
the course's repository, the second one contains the name of the course, the third one points to the course's website
and the last one refers to what technologies were used for each course. So, in alphabetical order:
