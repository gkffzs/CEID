## CEID Repository
Current repository will include several projects, scripts and programs that I've written as an undergraduate student
of the [Computer Engineering & Informatics Department](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/) (CEID) at the
[University of Patras](http://www.upatras.gr/). All descriptions will be in English, though some comments, reports or 
assignments may be in Greek. In general, there will be many updates.

#### List of courses

the undergraduate program at CEID. The complete course list can be found
