#### (23Y134) - Object Oriented Programming I [:link:](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en/undergraduate/courses/23%CE%A5134)
This repository contains the three course assignments for the academic period of 2011-2012, done by
[George Kaffezas](https://github.com/gkffzs). In order to test any of the source code, you should have a version of
[JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) installed, and you could use
[BlueJ](http://www.bluej.org/) as IDE, for easy import.

In each of these assignments we had at first to familiarize and experiment with several capabilities of Java and explore
their nature. The related exercises are specified in `general_lab_exercises.pdf`, which contains instructions and some
source code, given by the course professors. They can be found in each folder under the name `/AskisiXX`, where XX is
a number from 1 to 8. Beside that, we had to implement our own solutions to a set of exercises, that was announced in
each assignment. Their source code can be found in the remaining folders of each assignment's `sources` folder.

###### [Assignment #1](https://github.com/gkffzs/CEID/tree/master/23Y134/Assignment%20%231)
For this assignment we had to check exercises 1, 2 and 3 from `general_lab_exercises.pdf`, and also find solutions for
those specified in `Set1_assignment.pdf` (in Greek). In brief, we mainly had to implement some classes for the
representation of a box. The source files can be found under `/sources` folder, some images in `/images` folder, and the
respective report is `Set1_report.pdf`.

###### [Assignment #2](https://github.com/gkffzs/CEID/tree/master/23Y134/Assignment%20%232)
For this assignment we had to check exercises 4, 5 and 6 from `general_lab_exercises.pdf`, and also find solutions for
those specified in `Set2_assignment.pdf` (in Greek). The respective report is `Set2_report.pdf`. So, in brief, we had to:
- implement some classes and a program for managing different kinds of employees (see folder `/1_Askisi_2oSet`)
- write a program for the division of two numbers, with proper exception handling (see folder `/2_Askisi_2oSet`)
- create a program that reads from and writes to a text file, while performing some changes. (see folder
`/3_Askisi_2oSet`)

###### [Assignment #3](https://github.com/gkffzs/CEID/tree/master/23Y134/Assignment%20%233)
For this assignment we had to check exercises 7 and 8 from `general_lab_exercises.pdf`, and also find solutions for
those specified in `Set3_assignment.pdf` (in Greek). Also, the report for this assignment is `Set3_report.pdf`. In brief,
we had to:
- create a simple program for image manipulation, like resizing, aligning, etc. (see folder `/1_Askisi_3o_Set`) 
- create an applet for a simple puzzle, counting moves, etc. (see folder `2_Askisi_3o_Set`)
