#### (23Y231) - Object Oriented Programming II [:link:](https://www.ceid.upatras.gr/en/undergraduate/courses/23%CE%A5231)
This repository contains the course assignment for the academic period of 2013-2014, done by
[George Kaffezas](https://github.com/gkffzs), [Anastasia Paparrodopoulou](https://github.com/paparrodop-anast) and
[Aris Magripis](https://github.com/aris-mag). It's a simulation of a robot fleet moving on a planet, implemented in C++.

The robot fleet consists of various types of robots (ResearchRobot, AnalysisRobot and RescueRobot), each with its respective 
duty and function. The planet is represented as a 2-D map in the terminal. The goal of the simulation is the collection of
the specified quantities of various resources. A more detailed description can be found (in Greek) in `assignment.pdf`,
and more information about the implementation in `report.pdf` (also in Greek). Finally, you can see several screenshots
of the simulation in `/screenshots` folder. As an example, here is the initial screen:



In order to test the above program yourself, you could open the project file, `cpp_project_2014.cbp` (that you'll find in
the `/source_files` folder), in [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/), compile and run it by pressing F9. Ignore any
warnings, as they don't affect the run at all.
