# COMMAND #1
# "-e" selects all processes
# "--sort etime" defines the sorting type
ps -e --sort etime

# COMMAND #2
# "-e" selects all processes
# "--sort cputime" defines the sorting type
# "more" is used to control the output
ps -e --sort cputime | more

# COMMAND #3
# "/" defines the system as the search field
# "-type f" defines file as the search type
# "! -user root" excludes the files that belong to root
# "| more" is used to control the output
find / -type f ! -user root | more

# COMMAND #4
# "/" defines the system as the search field
# "-type d" to search for directories
# "-name '[ad]*'" to search for directories that begin with a or d
find / -type d -name '[ad]*'

# "sort -d" sorts the uniq command results in dictionary order
who | awk '{print $1}' | sort -d

# COMMAND #7
# "who" shows the users that are logged in the system
# "awk '{print $1}'" prints the first column of the who command results, thus the login names
# "sort" sorts the results in alphabetical order
# "uniq -d" shows once only the duplicate adjacent lines of the awk & sort command results,
# thus prints the users that are logged in more than twice
who | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -d

# COMMAND #8
# "last" displays the list of the users logged in this month from the /var/log/wtmp
